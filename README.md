# GoL.pp
A C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This program should, eventually, have at minimum the following functionality (if you want a version with all this functionality, I have implemented it in PyGame in another repo on my page):
1. Defineable play area and resolution (number of cells)
2. Play and pause via spacebar
3. Step through simulation forward and backward (while paused) via left and right arrow keys
4. "Random" button creates a (pseudo-)random soup of cells (while paused)
5. "Clear" button erases the grid state (while paused)
6. Cursor left-click places a live cell (paused or playing)
7. Grid is wrapped horizontally and vertically, creating a toroidal topology
